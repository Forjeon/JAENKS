Deflecting projectiles with projectiles and melee/vambrace (not reflecting but parrying by slightly changing incoming angle or imparting a small amount of horizontal momentum) 

Miming of slingshot / bow weapon

Fun projectile types with different effects such as movement of player, etc.

Base building

Waves and then breaks for crafting and base building

Water/underwater level

Ragdoll physics (tune for maximum comedy, less creepy)

Fishing

First and third person like Roblox 

Players can play as bad guys, even big ones (VR players especially can be the big guys

Radar in HUD

Hand tracking

Item, equipment, cosmetics, upgrades, etc. shop comes between or during waves

Flying moving base, objective is to make it from A to B

Titan shifting

Destructive terrain

Procedural world

Waves end at journey waypoints, which are safe and have shops, mining, etc.

Waves come continually but can be thinned out (AI director?)

3d and 2d art style

For Mom: 
surprises, Easter eggs, hidden areas
teamwork powers and combos
mining, farming, clearing things out (a la pacman, core keeper, Tetris)
story line
moving between screens/levels, each with their own set of mechanics and gameplay loops

Comedy (for Mom as well)

NPC interactions (friendships, hired hands and guns, etc.)

Puzzles, escape room

Vehicles like in Armoured Patrol (can be bought, built, repaired by players by hand)

Call-down abilities like in Section 8 and Helldivers 2?

Upgrades for home ship, vehicles, equipment, etc. using shared resource system like Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime
